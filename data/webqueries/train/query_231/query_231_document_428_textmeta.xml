	 CAMP RYAN, Kuwait -- Master Sgt. Frank Balkcom, a chief watch officer with I Marine Expeditionary Force, based in Camp Pendleton, Calif., is finally close enough to visit his son, Lance Cpl. Zachary L. Balkcom, a personnel clerk with Task Force Tarawa, based out of Camp Lejeune, N.C. A whole country separates the Marines back home, but in Kuwait they are close enough to visit whenever their missions allow them to. (Official U.S. Marine Corps photo by Lance Cpl. Shawn C. Rhodes)
