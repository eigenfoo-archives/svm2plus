	 Figure 3. Flow Chart. Schematic of empirical and mechanistic solutions for prediction of pavement distress. Flow chart depicts text boxes connecting in a downward direction in this order: Input, Material Characterization, Pavement Response, Pavement Behavior, Distress Manifestation, and Long-Term Performance History. A solid arrow connecting Input and Long-Term Performance History has the word EMPERICAL intersecting it. A dotted arrow running alongside from Material Characterization to Distress Manifestation has the word MECHANISTIC running parallel to it.
