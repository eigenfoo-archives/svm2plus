	 Montreal on Foot : Marche Bonsecours 
	 The Marche building was completed in January 1847 and has over its history been used for everything from a town hall to a makeshift parliament building. It's not even a market anymore, but more of a really interesting exhibition and retail space. There are many little galleries, and some artisans have studio space here as well. We saw a neat glass-blowing exhibit while strolling through.
