Since 1991, the Film Masterclass has a world renowned filmmaker or actor giving a public lesson. The Cannes film festival, the world's top showcase of cinema, started 11 May with a slew of veteran auteurs lining up for the prestigious Palme d'Or prize, and Hollywood muscling in to promote this year's blockbusters.
